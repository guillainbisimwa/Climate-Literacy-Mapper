    des: 'Users play a crucial role in mapping climate literacy in their communities. The app provides a template for translating climate change information and adaptation strategies into native languages. By contributing, users help empower their communities to better understand and adapt to climate change. This participatory approach ensures that climate information is not only accessible but also culturally relevant and actionable for local communities. The app serves as a resource for stakeholders working on environmental initiatives at the local level. ',

    des: "Our app is not a one-time initiative but a long-term platform for ongoing engagement and knowledge sharing. The repository of climate information can be continuously updated. As users contribute new translations the app's value grows, creating a dynamic and evolving resource for climate adaptation benefiting communities across Africa.",

    subtitle: 'Bridging the Climate Information Gap',
    des: "We need your help to identify which rural communities have climate change information available in their native languages, and which do not. This gap in literacy impacts rural communities' ability to adapt to climate change. Our app serves as a tool to map climate literacy across African tribes and languages, identifying where information is lacking. We emphasize the valuable connection between indigenous knowledge and modern climate science, recognizing that traditional ecological wisdom can complement and enhance scientific understanding of local climate patterns and adaptation strategies.",
